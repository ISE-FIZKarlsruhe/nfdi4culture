# NFDI4Culture Ontology (CTO)

This repository provides the NFDI4Culture Ontology (CTO) and its documentation. CTO is a domain-specific ontology module developed within the Task Area 5 of the NFDI4Culture initiative. The ontology builds upon the NFDIcore mid-level ontology v3 and is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) 2020 to ensure semantic interoperability and ontological rigor.

## Scope
The main scope of CTO is the representation of cultural heritage research data within a data index, i.e. a single point of access to decentralized cultural heritage research resources. The ontology supports the integration of research (meta)data harvested through a dedicated ETL pipeline. Its main focus is the creation of a lightweight index of cultural heritage research data provided by the culture community, including but not limited to the subject areas of musicology, performing arts, media studies, architecture, and art history.

The key aspects of CTO concern:

- **The consortium and its infrastructure:** persons and organizations involved in research processes, services, guidelines, standards, and events
- **The content of cultural heritage research data:** cultural heritage objects, persons, locations and events referenced in the provided data, associated media, references to external vocabularies used for the identification and classification of the provided research data
- **Access and reuse:** legal statements, contact persons, standards, and export formats
