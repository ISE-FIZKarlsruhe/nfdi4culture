This is where we test ideas and do development work on the [knowledge graph of the NFDI4Culture consortium](https://nfdi4culture.de/resources/knowledge-graph.html).

This is the feeding ground for what eventually ends up in the [Culture Knowledge Graph Kitchen](https://gitlab.rlp.net/adwmainz/nfdi4culture/knowledge-graph/culture-kg-kitchen/)

## Information Graph

The Information Graph (IG) contains the general information about the consortium, based on the [LOD extension](https://github.com/digicademy/lod) for TYPO3 developed by the [Digital Academy in Mainz](https://www.adwmainz.de/digitalitaet/digitale-akademie.html).

## Research Data Graph

The Research Data Graph (RDG) is the bulk research data as contributed by the [various datafeeds](https://nfdi4culture.de/go/sparql-data-portals) from the consortium participants that functions as an index of culture research data.
