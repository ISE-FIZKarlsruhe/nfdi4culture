# NFDI4Culture Ontology (CTO)

[NFDI4Culture](https://nfdi4culture.de/) is the Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage. Within NFDI4Culture, a [Knowledge Graph](https://nfdi4culture.de/resources/knowledge-graph.html) has been developed and integrated with the [Culture Information Portal](https://nfdi4culture.de/) with the goal to aggregate heterogeneous and isolated data from the research landscape focused on by NFDI4Culture and thereby increase the discoverability, interoperability and reusability of cultural heritage data. 

This repository provides the NFDI4Culture Ontology (CTO) and its documentation. CTO is a domain-specific ontology module developed within the Task Area 5 of the NFDI4Culture initiative. The ontology builds upon the NFDIcore mid-level ontology and is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) 2020 to ensure semantic interoperability and ontological rigor.
CTO represents the research data of the NFDI4Culture community within a research data index, i.e. a single point of access to decentralized cultural heritage research resources. The ontology supports the integration of research (meta)data, harvested using a dedicated [ETL pipeline](https://nfdi4culture.de/id/E5877). 

The ontology’s latest version is always accessible at: [cto.owl](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdi4culture/blob/main/cto.owl)  
A generated list of resources via Widoco is available at: [https://nfdi4culture.de/ontology](https://nfdi4culture.de/ontology) 

## Ontology Scope
The main focus of CTO is the creation of a light-weight index of cultural heritage research data provided by the culture community. This includes but is not limited to the subject areas musicology, performing arts, media studies, architecture, and art history. The key aspects of CTO concern:

- **The consortium and its infrastructure:** persons and organizations involved in research processes, services, guidelines, standards, and events
- **The content of cultural heritage research data:** cultural heritage objects, persons, locations and events referenced in the provided data, associated media, references to external vocabularies used for the identification and classification of the provided research data
- **Access and reuse:** legal statements, contact persons, standards, and export formats
