[Lightweight Information Describing Objects](https://lido-schema.org/) is an XML harvesting schema.

Be wary of any system that has the word "lightweight" in its name or description. It seldom is. Be that as it may, LIDO has been used as a standard in many cultural heritage contexts (mostly museums).
