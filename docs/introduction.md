# CTO in the Context of NFDI4Culture

[NFDI4Culture](https://nfdi4culture.de/) is the Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage. As a consortium within the framework of the German national research data infrastructure programme [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de) the goal of NFDI4Culture is the establishment of a information infrastructure for cultural heritage research data. This primarily concerns the subject areas architecture, art history, performing arts, musicology, and media sciences. 

Within NFDI4Culture, a [Knowledge Graph](https://nfdi4culture.de/resources/knowledge-graph.html) has been developed and integrated with the [Culture Information Portal](https://nfdi4culture.de/) with the goal to aggregate heterogeneous and isolated data from the research landscape focused on by NFDI4Culture and thereby increase the discoverability, interoperability and reusability of cultural heritage data. The NFDI4Culture Knowledge Graph acts as a single point of access to decentralized cultural heritage research resources. 

## Information Graph

The Information Graph (IG) contains the general information about the consortium, based on the [LOD extension](https://github.com/digicademy/lod) for TYPO3 developed by the [Digital Academy in Mainz](https://www.adwmainz.de/digitalitaet/digitale-akademie.html).

## Research Data Graph

The Research Data Graph (RDG) is the bulk research data as contributed by the [various datafeeds](https://nfdi4culture.de/go/sparql-data-portals) from the consortium participants that functions as an index of culture research data.
